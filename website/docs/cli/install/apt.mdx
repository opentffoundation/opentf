# APT Packages for Debian and Ubuntu

The primary distribution packages for OpenTF are `.zip` archives containing
single executable files that you can extract anywhere on your system. However,
for easier integration with configuration management tools and other systematic
system configuration strategies, we also offer package repositories for
Debian and Ubuntu systems, which allow you to install OpenTF using the
`apt install` command or any other APT frontend.

If you are instead using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora, you
might prefer to [install OpenTF from our Yum repositories](/opentf/cli/install/yum).

## Repository Configuration

Please follow the instructions in the [Official Packaging Guide](https://www.placeholderplaceholderplaceholder.com/official-packaging-guide).

## Supported Architectures

The OpenTF APT server has packages only for the `amd64`
architecture, which is also sometimes known as `x86_64`.

There are no official packages available for other architectures, such as
`arm64`. If you wish to use OpenTF on a non-`amd64` system,
[download a normal release `.zip` file](/opentf/downloads) instead.

## Installing a Specific Version of OpenTF

The OpenTF APT repositories contain multiple versions of OpenTF, but
because the packages are all named `opentf` it is impossible to install
more than one version at a time, and `apt install` will default to selecting
the latest version.

It's often necessary to match your OpenTF version with what a particular
configuration is currently expecting. You can use the following command to
see which versions are currently available in the repository index:

```bash
apt policy opentf
```

If your workflow requires using multiple versions of OpenTF at the same
time, for example when working through a gradual upgrade where not all
of your configurations are upgraded yet, we recommend that you use the
official release `.zip` files instead of the APT packages, so you can install
multiple versions at once and then select which to use for each command you
run.

All published packages include a revision number by
default, starting with `-1`. This change means that in the case that we need
to publish an updated package for any reason, installers can automatically
retrieve the latest revision.

You can install the latest revision for a particular version by including the
version in the `apt install` command, as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install opentf=1.4.4-*
```
