# Resource Importability

Each resource in OpenTF must implement some basic logic to become
importable. As a result, you cannot import all OpenTF resources.

The resources that you can import are documented at the bottom of
each resource documentation page in the [public Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/). If you have issues importing a resource, report an issue in the relevant provider repository.

To make a resource importable, refer to [Extending OpenTF: Resources — Import](/opentf/plugin/sdkv2/resources/import).
