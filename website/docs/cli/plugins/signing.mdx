# Plugin Signing

<!-- THIS PAGED IS LINKED TO IN THE CLI -->

:::warning Note
OpenTofu only authenticates provider plugins fetched from a registry.
:::

OpenTofu providers installed from the Registry are cryptographically signed and the signature
is verified at time of installation.

OpenTofu does **NOT** support fetching and using unsigned binaries, but you can manually install
unsigned binaries. You should take extreme care when doing so as no programatic authentication is performed.
