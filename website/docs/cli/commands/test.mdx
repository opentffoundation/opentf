    The tofu test command performs integration tests of OpenTofu modules.
---

# Command: test

The `tofu test` command runs integration tests to ensure intended behavior of your OpenTofu configuration. It creates real
infrastructure, asserts conditional checks against the attributes of provisioned resources and attempts
to clean up the testing infrastructure upon completion.

## Usage

Usage: `tofu test [options]`.

The `test` command executes the automated integration tests following to the steps below:

1. Define a test `suite` by reading [test files](#how-to-define-a-test-file) `*.tftest.hcl`.
2. Read all global input [variables](#variables) applicable for the whole test suite.
3. Define the tests execution order by sorting the test files in alphabetical order based on their names.
4. Sequentially execute all test files in the `suite`:
    1. Sequentially execute all test [`runs`](#run-block) defined in a single test file:
        1. Prepare and validate the `run` configuration;
        2. Perform `tofu plan+apply`, or `tofu apply`;
        3. Check expected failures;
        4. Check assertion conditions;
        5. Record the `status`.
    2. Destroy provisioned resources.
5. Report the test status.

## General Options

* `-test-directory=path` Set the test directory (default: "tests"). OpenTofu will search for test files in the set directory
as well as in the directly in which `tofu test` was executed.

:::warning
The path should be relative to the directory in which `tofu test` is called.
:::

* `-filter=testfile` Specify an individual test file to use for testing.
The option can be used multiple times to specify several files.

:::warning
The path should be relative to the directory in which `tofu test` is called.
:::

* `-var 'foo=bar'` Set the input variables of the root module.
The option can be used multiple times to set several variables.

* `-var-file=filename` Set the path to the file with variables values in addition to the default
files terraform.tfvars and *.auto.tfvars. The option can be used multiple times to specify several files.

* `-json` Set for test outputs to be formatted as JSON.

* `-no-color` Disable color codes in the command output.

* `-verbose` Print the plan or state for each test run block as it executes.

## Usage examples

### Flat structure

**GIVEN** the following OpenTofu module structure:

```commandline
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── main.tf
├── main.tftest.hcl
├── foo.tf
├── foo.tftest.hcl
├── bar.tf
├── bar.tftest.hcl
├── outputs.tf
└── variables.tf
```

**WHEN** `tofu test` is executed in the project directory,

**THEN** the tests defined in the following files will be run (note that the files are sorted in alphabetical order):

- bar.tftest.hcl,
- foo.tftest.hcl,
- main.tftest.hcl.

**WHEN** `tofu test -filter=foo.tftest.hcl -filter=bar.tftest.hcl` is executed in the project directory,

**THEN** the tests defined in the files `foo.tftest.hcl` and `bar.tftest.hcl` will be run only.

### Nested structure

**GIVEN** the following OpenTofu module structure:

```commandline
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── main.tf
├── main.tftest.hcl
├── outputs.tf
├── variables.tf
├── tests
│   └── foo.tftest.hcl
└── submodule
    ├── foo.tf
    ├── foo.tftest.hcl
    ├── main.tf
    ├── main.tftest.hcl
    ├── outputs.tf
    ├── variables.tf
    └── tests
        └── foo.tftest.hcl
```

**WHEN** `tofu test` is executed in the project root directory,

**THEN** the tests defined in the following files will be run (note that the files are sorted in alphabetical order):

- main.tftest.hcl,
- tests/foo.tftest.hcl.

**WHEN** `tofu test -test-directory=submodule` is executed in the project root directory,

**THEN** the tests defined in the following files will be run (note that the files are sorted in alphabetical order):

- main.tftest.hcl,
- submodule/foo.tftest.hcl,
- submodule/main.tftest.hcl.

**WHEN** `tofu test -test-directory=submodule -filter=foo.tftest.hcl` is executed in the project root directory,

**THEN** no tests will be run because no test files satisfying filtering criteria will be found.

**WHEN** `tofu test -test-directory=submodule -filter=submodule/foo.tftest.hcl` is executed in the project root directory,

**THEN** the tests defined in the file `submodule/foo.tftest.hcl` will be run only.

## How to define a test file

Tests are defined using three kinds of blocks in the way that every test file

- _shall_ contain _at least one_ `run` block to define a single test;
- _may_ contain _at most one_ `variables` block to define "global" variables shared by all `runs` defined in a single file;
- _may_ contain _multiple_ `provider` blocks to configure providers shared used by all `runs` in a single file.

:::info
Note that if a test file contains several `run` blocks, OpenTofu will execute them sequentially from the top to
the bottom of the file.
:::

### `run` block

<!-- details: /internal/configs/test_file.go:239 decodeTestRunBlock -->

The `run` block defines a _single test_. It specifies the operation which OpenTofu will execute,
sets mocks for providers,
and defines the checks to assess the state after the OpenTofu operation was executed.

The following non-mutually exclusive blocks and attributes can be defined within the scope of the `run` block to configure the test.

| Name              | Type   | Multiple allowed | Description                                                                                                                          |
|:------------------|:-------|:-----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `assert`          | block  | true             | Defines the state assessment criteria and the assertion message.                                                                     |
| `expect_failures` | list   | false            | Defines the check for "unhappy path" by listing resources and values which are expected to fail as the result of OpenTofu operation. |
| `variables`       | block  | false            | Defines "local" variables as [key-value pairs](/docs/language/expressions/types/#mapsobjects).                                       |
| `command`         | string | false            | Defines the command which OpenTofu will execute, _plan_ or _apply_. Defaults to _apply_.                                             |
| `plan_options`    | block  | false            | Defines options for the _plan_ operation.                                                                                            |
| `module`          | block  | false            | Defines module used at execution of the OpenTofu operation.                                                                          |
| `providers`       | object | false            | Defines aliases to mock providers.                                                                                                   |

Find below detailed description of every listed attribute.

### `run.assert`

The `assert` block is the key configuration which defines how to assess OpenTofu configuration behavior against
a reference using two required attributes:

- `condition`: check [condition](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/expressions/custom-conditions#condition-expressions)
as a boolean expression.
- `error_message`: assertion message which will be printed if the test fails.

```hcl
run "test" {
  variables {
    want_attr0 = "test-value"
    want_attr1 = 1
  }

  assert {
    condition     = resource_type.resource_name.attr0 == var.want_attr0
    error_message = "failed validation of attr0"
  }

  assert {
    condition     = resource_type.resource_name.attr1 == var.want_attr1
    error_message = "failed validation of attr1"
  }
}
```

:::info
If several assertions are present in a single `run`, they will be run sequentially, and if some of them fail,
the total numer of failed tests will be reported as 1.
The opposite is also true, 1 successful test will be reported if all checks are successful.
:::

### `run.module`

The `module` block defines a module used during the execution of the OpenTofu operation within the scope of the test.
It is useful for mocking providers required by the tested OpenTofu configuration.

The `module` block is defined by two attributes:

- `source` (required): module [source](/docs/language/modules/sources).
- `version` (optional): module version.

```hcl
run "setup-module" {
  module {
    source = "./modules/my_module"
  }
}
```

### `run.plan_options`

The `plan_options` block can be used to defined how OpenTofu will execute the `plan` command during the test.

It can be configured by the following optional attributes.

| Name    | Type   | Default  | Description                                                            |
|:--------|:-------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mode    | string | "normal" | The planning mode to run. Allowed values: _normal_ or _refresh-only_.  |
| refresh | bool   | true     | Analog to `tofu plan -refresh`.                                        |
| replace | list   | null     | Analog to `tofu plan -refresh=ADDRESS`.                                |
| target  | list   | null     | Analog to `tofu plan -target=ADDRESS`.                                 |

:::warning
If the `mode` is set to _refresh-only_, the `refresh` parameter cannot be set to _false_.
:::

### `run.providers`

The `providers` object allows to mock providers for execution of the `run`.

### `run.expect_failures`

The `expect_failures` attribute lists the resources, or variable which are expected to fail during the test. It

```hcl
run "unhappy-path" {
  variable {
    input0 = "faulty-input"
  }
  expect_failures = [
    # we expect the module to validate the input,
    # and the validation to fail given the wrong input value defined in the variables block
    input.input0,
  ]
}
```

### `provider` block

<!-- details: /internal/command/testing/test_provider.go -->

The `provier` block defines a single provider shared by all tests defined in a single test file.

It is defined by the following attributes.

| Name            | Type   | Description                                                                                          |
|:----------------|:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| alias           | string | The provider's alies within the scope of a given test file.                                          |
| resource_prefix | string | The OpenTofu configuration tag word used to recognize a [resource](docs/language/resources/syntax/). |
| data_prefix     | string | The OpenTofu configuration tag word used to recognize a [data source](/docs/language/data-sources/). |

## Variables

Tests can be defined using variables specified in several ways.

The variables will be loaded in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

| Order  | Source                                                                                                                         | Scope            |
|:------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
|   1    | Environment variables with the prefix `TF_VAR_`;                                                                               | All test files   |
|   2    | tfvar files specified: `terraform.tfvars` and `*.auto.tfvars`;                                                                 | All test files   |
|   3    | Commandline variables defined using the flag `-var`, and the variables defined in the files specified by the flag `-var-file`; | All test files   |
|   4    | The variables from the `variables` block in a test file.                                                                       | Single test file |
|   5    | The variables from the `variables` block in `run` block.                                                                       | Single test      |

:::info
The variable value defined by the flags `-var` and `-var-file` will depend on their order: the latest found value will be used.

For example, **given** that the file `test.tfvars` contains the value `my_var="bar"`,
**when** `tofu test -var=my_var="foo" -var-file=test.tfvars -var=my_var="qux"` is executed,
**then** the variable `my_var` will be assigned the value `"qux"`.
