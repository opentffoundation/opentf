  combine values in expressions.

# Functions

## Built-in Functions

The OpenTofu language includes a number of built-in functions that you can
call from within expressions to transform and combine values. The general
syntax for function calls is a function name followed by comma-separated
arguments in parentheses:

```hcl
max(5, 12, 9)
```

For more details on syntax, see
[_Function Calls_](/docs/language/expressions/function-calls)
in the Expressions section.

You can experiment with the behavior of OpenTofu's built-in functions from
the OpenTofu expression console, by running
[the `tofu console` command](/docs/cli/commands/console):

```
> max(5, 12, 9)
12
```

The examples in the documentation for each function use console output to
illustrate the result of calling the function with different parameters.

## Provider-defined Functions

As of OpenTofu 1.7.0, providers may define their own functions to be available during
execution.

OpenTofu iterates through the [required_providers](/docs/language/providers/requirements/) block
and queries the specified providers for any functions they wish to register. Functions are
added to the current module's context under `provider::<provider_name>::<function_name>`.
Functions are scoped to the module that requires the provider and are not inherited by child modules.

### Example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    myhelper = {
      # yantrio/helpers registers a function named "echo"
      source = "yantrio/helpers"
    }
  }
}

locals {
  myval = provider::myhelper::echo("Hello Functions!")
}
```


### Notes for Provider Authors:
* Support for functions was added in protocol version 5.5 and 6.5
* OpenTofu's provider protocol is compatible with Terraform's provider protocol
* CallFunction is executed on an *Unconfigured* instance of the provider
