# Syntax

The majority of the OpenTF language documentation focuses on the practical
uses of the language and the specific constructs it uses. The pages in this
section offer a more abstract view of the OpenTF language.

- [Configuration Syntax](/opentf/language/syntax/configuration) describes the native
  grammar of the OpenTF language.
- [JSON Configuration Syntax](/opentf/language/syntax/json) documents
  how to represent OpenTF language constructs in the pure JSON variant of the
  OpenTF language. OpenTF's JSON syntax is unfriendly to humans, but can
  be very useful when generating infrastructure as code with other systems that
  don't have a readily available HCL library.
- [Style Conventions](/opentf/language/syntax/style) documents some commonly
  accepted formatting guidelines for OpenTF code. These conventions can be
  enforced automatically with [`opentf fmt`](/opentf/cli/commands/fmt).
