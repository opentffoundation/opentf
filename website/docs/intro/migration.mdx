# Migrating to OpenTofu from Terraform

OpenTofu 1.6 is compatible with Terraform 1.6. This migration guide will take you through the process of switching from
Terraform to OpenTofu.

## Step 0: Prepare a disaster recovery plan

Although OpenTofu 1.6 is very similar to Terraform 1.6, it is a non-trivial change affecting your infrastructure. Make
sure you have an up to date and *tested* disaster recovery plan.

## Step 1: Apply all changes with Terraform

Before proceeding, make sure that you apply all changes with `terraform apply`. Running `terraform plan` should result
in no planned changes. While you can switch to OpenTofu with pending changes, it is not recommended.

```
$ terraform plan

...

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your
configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

## Step 2: Install OpenTofu

As a first step, please [follow the installation instructions for the OpenTofu CLI tool](../install/). Please test if
you can successfully execute the `tofu` command:

```
$ tofu --version
OpenTofu v1.6.0
on linux_amd64
```

## Step 3: Back up your state file

Before you begin using the `tofu` binary on your Terraform code, make sure to back up your state file. If you are using
a local state file, you can simply make a copy of your `terraform.tfstate` file in your project directory.

If you are using a remote backend such as an S3 bucket, make sure that you follow the backup procedures for the
backend and that you exercise the restore procedure at least once.

## Step 4: Initialize OpenTofu

:::warning

Should any of the following steps fail, please do not proceed and follow the
[rollback instructions below](#rolling-back-to-terraform-and-reporting-issues) instead.
If you suspect the failure may be the result of a bug in OpenTofu,
[please help us by opening an issue](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues).

:::

Now you are ready to migrate. Run `tofu init` in the directory where your Terraform code resides. OpenTofu will download
any providers and modules referenced in your configuration from the OpenTofu registry.

## Step 5: Inspect the plan

Once initialized, run `tofu plan` and ensure that there are no pending changes similar to step 1 above. If there are
unexpected changes in the plan, roll back to Terraform and troubleshoot your migration. (See the Troubleshooting section
below.)

```
$ tofu plan

...

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

OpenTofu has compared your real infrastructure against your
configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

## Step 6: Test out a small change

Before you begin using OpenTofu for larger changes, test out `tofu apply` with a smaller, non-critical
change.

## Rolling back to Terraform and reporting issues

If you have issues migrating to OpenTofu you can follow these steps to roll back to Terraform:

1. Create another backup of your state file.
2. Run `terraform init`.
3. Run `terraform plan` and verify that no unexpected changes are in the plan.
4. Test the rollback with a small, non-critical change.

If you encountered a bug, [please report it on GitHub](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the migration to OpenTofu, you can join the [OpenTofu Slack](/slack) or ask on
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/opentofu/discussions).

### Error: Failed to query available provider packages

This error happens when a provider you specified in your configuration is not available in the OpenTofu registry.
Please roll back to Terraform and make sure your code works with Terraform. If your code works, please
[submit an issue to include the provider in the registry](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/issues/).

### Error: Module not found

This error happens when a module you specified in your configuration is not available in the OpenTofu registry.
Please roll back to Terraform and make sure your code works with Terraform. If your code works, please
[submit an issue to include the module in the registry](https://github.com/opentofu/registry/issues/).
