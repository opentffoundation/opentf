# What's new in OpenTofu 1.7?

This page will run you through the most important changes in OpenTofu 1.7:

- [State encryption](#state-encryption)
- [Provider-defined functions](#provider-defined-functions)
- [Removed block](#removed-block)
- [Loopable import blocks](#loopable-import-blocks)
- [Built-in function changes](#built-in-function-changes)
- [CLI changes](#cli-changes)
- [Testing feature changes](#testing-feature-changes)

## State encryption

State encryption is one of the flagship features of this release. We have prepared a [full documentation](../language/state/encryption.mdx) for this feature.

Before you test this feature, please **make a backup** of your state file. You can then add the following block to enable state encryption:

```hcl
terraform {
  encryption {
    key_provider "pbkdf2" "my_passphrase" {
      ## Enter a passphrase here:
      passphrase = ""
    }

    method "aes_gcm" "my_method" {
      keys = key_provider.pbkdf2.my_passphrase
    }

    ## Remove this after the migration:
    method "unencrypted" "migration" {
    }

    state {
      method = method.aes_gcm.my_method

      ## Remove the fallback block after migration:
      fallback{
        method = method.unencrypted.migration
      }
      ## Enable this after migration:
      #enforced = true
    }
  }
}
```

You can migrate back using the following syntax:

```hcl
terraform {
  encryption {
    key_provider "pbkdf2" "my_passphrase" {
      ## Enter a passphrase here:
      passphrase = ""
    }

    method "aes_gcm" "my_method" {
      keys = key_provider.pbkdf2.my_passphrase
    }

    method "unencrypted" "migration" {
    }

    state {
      method  = method.unencrypted.migration
      enforced = false
      fallback{
        method = method.aes_gcm.my_method
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you have access to an AWS, GCP account, or an OpenBao/MPL-licensed HashiCorp Vault installation, you can also [test these key providers](../language/state/encryption.mdx#key-providers).

## Provider-defined functions

The new Terraform Plugin SDK added support for [provider-defined functions](../language/functions/index.mdx#provider-defined-functions) that you can use directly in OpenTofu. This is a significant improvement over using data sources as provider-defined functions don't increase the size of your state file and require less code to write.

If you want to test provider-defined functions, you can use the [corefunc](https://library.tf/providers/northwood-labs/corefunc/latest) provider by [Ryan Parman](https://github.com/skyzyx):

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    corefunc = {
      source = "northwood-labs/corefunc"
      version = "1.4.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "corefunc" {
}

output "test" {
  value = provider::corefunc::str_snake("Hello world!")
  # Prints: hello_world
}
```

What's more, we added an OpenTofu-only feature to let providers dynamically define custom functions based on your configuration. This enhancement allows you to fully integrate other programming languages as [shown in our live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OXBv0MYalY). You can try out this functionality with our experimental [Lua](https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-lua) and [Go](https://github.com/opentofu/terraform-provider-go) providers.

## Removed block

The removed block lets you remove a resource from the state file but keep it on the infrastructure. We have prepared a [full documentation](../language/resources/syntax.mdx#removing-resources) for this feature. You can test it by creating a resource first:

```hcl
resource "local_file" "test" {
  content = "Hello world!"
  filename = "test.txt"
}
```

After applying, you can replace the resource with a removed block:

```hcl
removed {
  from = local_file.test
}
```

After the next apply, you will see that the `local_file.test` resource no longer exists in your state file, but the `test.txt` file should still exist on your disk. You can now remove the removed block safely.

## Loopable import blocks

We made several improvements to the declarative import blocks, most prominently you can now use the `for_each` instruction on the block. We have prepared a [full documentation](../language/import/index.mdx#importing-multiple-resources) for this feature.

In previous OpenTofu versions, you could already use the `import` block to declaratively import resources, for example:

```hcl
resource "random_id" "test_id" {
  byte_length = 8
}

import {
  to = random_id.test_id
  id = "Y2FpOGV1Mkk"
}

output "id" {
  value = random_id.test_id.b64_url
}
```

In this new version you can now also declaratively import resources in a loop:

```hcl
variable "server_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "random_id" "test_id" {
  byte_length = 8
  count = 2
}

import {
  to = random_id.test_id[tonumber(each.key)]
  id = each.value
  for_each = {
    for idx, item in var.server_ids: idx => item
  }
}

output "id" {
  value = random_id.test_id.*.b64_url
}
```

The example above will let you specify some random IDs from a variable, and let others be automatically generated.

## Built-in function changes

This release also contains several new functions and changes to existing functions:

- New function: [templatestring](../language/functions/templatestring.mdx)
- New function: [base64gunzip](../language/functions/base64gunzip.mdx)
- New function: [cidrcontains](../language/functions/cidrcontains.mdx)
- New function: [urldecode](../language/functions/urldecode.mdx)
- New function: [issensitive](../language/functions/issensitive.mdx)
- [nonsensitive](../language/functions/nonsensitive.mdx) no longer returns an error when the applied values are not sensitive.
- [templatefile](../language/functions/templatefile.mdx) now supports recursion up to a depth of 1024.

## CLI changes

There are also several changes to the CLI:

- `tofu init` now supports the `-json` flag for JSON output.
- `tofu plan` now has a `-concise` flag to shorten the plan output.
- `tofu console` now works on Solaris and AIX.
- The CLI now supports the XDG directory specification.
- Aliases for:
    - `state list` &rarr; `state ls`
    - `state mv` &rarr; `state move`
    - `state rm` &rarr; `state remove`

## Testing feature changes

- Tofu now reads the `.tfvars` file from the tests folder.
