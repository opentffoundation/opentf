# Installing OpenTofu on .deb-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

OpenTofu is distributed in the .deb package format on [Packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/opentofu/tofu). You can install it using a convenience script or by following the step-by-step instructions below.

## Installing using the convenience script

You can install OpenTofu using the [convenience script](https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/opentofu/tofu/script.deb.sh?any=true) with the following commands:

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebConvenienceScript}</CodeBlock>

## Step-by-step instructions

The following steps explain how to set up the OpenTofu Debian repositories. These instructions should work on most Debian-based Linux systems.

### Installing tooling

In order to add the repositories, you will need to install some tooling. On most Debian-based operating systems, these tools will already be installed.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep1Script}</CodeBlock>

### Set up the OpenTofu repository

First, you need to make sure you have a copy of the OpenTofu GPG key. This verifies that your packages have indeed been created using the official pipeline and have not been tampered with.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep2Script}</CodeBlock>

Now you have to create the OpenTofu source list.

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep3Script}</CodeBlock>

### Installing OpenTofu

Finally, you can install OpenTofu:

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{DebStep4Script}</CodeBlock>
