# Installing OpenTofu on .deb-based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)

OpenTofu is distributed in the .deb package format on [Packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/opentofu/tofu). You can install it using a convenience script or by following the step-by-step instructions below.

## Installing using the convenience script

You can install OpenTofu using the [convenience script](https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/opentofu/tofu/script.deb.sh?any=true) with the following commands:

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/opentofu/tofu/script.deb.sh?any=true -o /tmp/tofu-repository-setup.sh
# Inspect the downloaded script at /tmp/tofu-repository-setup.sh before running
sudo bash /tmp/tofu-repository-setup.sh
rm /tmp/tofu-repository-setup.sh

sudo apt-get install tofu
```

## Step-by-step instructions

The following steps explain how to set up the OpenTofu Debian repositories. These instructions should work on most Debian-based Linux systems.

### Installing tooling

In order to add the repositories, you will need to install some tooling. On most Debian-based operating systems, these tools will already be installed.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

### Set up the OpenTofu repository

First, you need to make sure you have a copy of the OpenTofu GPG key. This verifies that your packages have indeed been created using the official pipeline and have not been tampered with.

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://packagecloud.io/opentofu/tofu/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/opentofu.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/opentofu.gpg
```

Now you have to create the OpenTofu source list.

```bash
echo \
  "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/opentofu.gpg] https://packagecloud.io/opentofu/tofu/any/ any main
deb-src [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/opentofu.gpg] https://packagecloud.io/opentofu/tofu/any/ any main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opentofu.list > /dev/null
```

### Installing OpenTofu

Finally, you can install OpenTofu:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tofu
```
