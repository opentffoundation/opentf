# Installing OpenTofu via Homebrew

You can use OpenTofu as a [portable binary](portable.mdx) or you can install it using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/opentofu). OpenTofu is available in the Homebrew Core repository, so you can install it by running:

<CodeBlock language={"bash"}>{BrewScript}</CodeBlock>
