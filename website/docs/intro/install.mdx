# Installing OpenTofu

## Installing via direct download

The most direct method to install OpenTofu is to download it from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/latest). Each GitHub release has an Assets section, where you can find the `zip` archive for your platform and download it. Once you download a zip archive from there, you can unzip it and move the `tofu` binary into your $PATH, e.g. into `/usr/local/bin` on many Unix operating systems.

On Linux and MacOS, you can use the following commands to install OpenTofu:

```bash
TOFU_VERSION="1.6.0-alpha2"
OS="$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
ARCH="$(uname -m | sed -e 's/aarch64/arm64/' -e 's/x86_64/amd64/')"
TEMPDIR="$(mktemp -d)"
pushd "${TEMPDIR}" >/dev/null
wget "https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/download/v${TOFU_VERSION}/tofu_${TOFU_VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.zip"
unzip "tofu_${TOFU_VERSION}_${OS}_${ARCH}.zip"
sudo mv tofu /usr/local/bin/tofu
popd >/dev/null
rm -rf "${TEMPDIR}"
echo "OpenTofu is now available at /usr/local/bin/tofu."
```

On Windows, you can use the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
$TOFU_VERSION="1.6.0-alpha2"
$TARGET=Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA OpenTofu
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $TARGET
Push-Location $TARGET
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/download/v${TOFU_VERSION}/tofu_${TOFU_VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip" -OutFile "tofu_${TOFU_VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip"
Expand-Archive "tofu_${TOFU_VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip" -DestinationPath $TARGET
Remove-Item "tofu_${TOFU_VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip"
$TOFU_PATH=Join-Path $TARGET tofu.exe
Pop-Location
echo "OpenTofu is now available at ${TOFU_PATH}. Please add it to your path for easier access."
```
