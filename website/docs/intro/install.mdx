# Installing OpenTofu

## Installing via direct download

The most direct method to install OpenTofu is to download it from GitHub releases. Each GitHub release has an Assets section, where you can find the `zip` archive for your platform and download it.

Once you download a zip archive from there, you can unzip it and move the `tofu` binary into your $PATH, e.g. into `/usr/local/bin` on many Unix operating systems.

You could, for example, run these commands:

```bash
wget https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/download/v1.6.0-alpha2/tofu_1.6.0-alpha2_darwin_arm64.zip
unzip tofu_1.6.0-alpha2_darwin_arm64.zip
mv tofu /usr/local/bin/tofu
```

to install OpenTofu on an arm64 MacOS system.

You can find the latest GitHub release of OpenTofu [here](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/latest).
