# OpenTF Internals

This section covers the internals of OpenTF and explains how
plans are generated, the lifecycle of a provider, etc. The goal
of this section is to remove any notion of "magic" from OpenTF.
We want you to be able to trust and understand what OpenTF is
doing to function.

:::note
Knowledge of OpenTF internals is not
required to use OpenTF. If you aren't interested in the internals
of OpenTF, you may safely skip this section.
