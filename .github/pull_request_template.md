## Target Release

<!--

In normal circumstances we only target changes at the upcoming minor
release, or as a patch to the current minor version. If you need to
port a security fix to an older release, highlight this here by listing
all targeted releases.

1.6.0

<!--

Write a short description of the user-facing change. Examples:

- `tofu show -json`: Fixed crash with sensitive set values.
- When rendering a diff, OpenTofu now quotes the name of any object attribute whose string representation is not a valid identifier.
- The local token configuration in the cloud and remote backend now has higher priority than a token specified in a credentials block in the CLI configuration.
